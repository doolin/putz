# Putz

PDD (puts driven development) is a greedy algorithm optimizing for
linewise development at the expense of maintainability, readability,
correctness and design.

That is, your program may be optimal considering one line to the next,
but perfectly horrible when considered as a whole.

PDD is a terrible addiction, and we're here to help.
